#Tom D'Alleva - This is a new project to reverse engineer arp.c and ipconfig.com 
to make it easier and clearer to find all current IP addresses on a local LAN and give status. 

It might have to ping the broadcast address toinsure arp tables are current. The user interface will be tabular in nature 
and give some status indicators.

This project has not yet begun. It will probably use C# or Visual C++ under windows and C++ under Linux.
This is a side project that I don't think I'll get to until winter of 2015.

The code in this repo is just reference source code.
