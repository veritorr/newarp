#Tom D'Alleva - This is a new project in the planning stages to combine some of the functionality of arp and ipconfig 
to create a user-friendly graphical representation of all current users, IP addresses and their statuses on a LAN. 

It will ping the broadcast address to insure arp tables are current. The user interface will be tabular in nature 
and give some status indicators.

This is a side project that I don't think I'll get to until mid 2015.  It will be released to the public.

The code in this repo is just stored reference source code but not sure it will be used for the actual project.
